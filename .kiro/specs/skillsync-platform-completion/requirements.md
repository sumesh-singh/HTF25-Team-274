# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SkillSync Platform Completion project aims to transform the existing frontend prototype into a fully functional peer-to-peer skill exchange platform. Based on the comprehensive PRD and SRS provided, SkillSync is positioned as a unique platform that connects users who want to teach or learn specific skills through AI-powered matching, structured sessions, gamified credit economy, and community-driven learning experiences. This document outlines the requirements to complete the missing functionality and integrate the comprehensive backend services as specified in the PRD/SRS.
